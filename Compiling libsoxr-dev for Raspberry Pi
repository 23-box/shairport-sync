At the time of writing, the Raspbian image 2015-01-31-raspbian does not include libsoxr, not is it available as a package via `apt-get`.
It is, however, easy to compile, and works well with Shairport Sync on the Raspberry Pi. Here are very brief instructions to download, compile and install it so that it can be used with Shairport Sync.

1 Download `cmake`. This is used in the building of libsoxr:
`sudo apt-get install cmake`
