What it is
----------
This program emulates an Airport Express for the purpose of streaming music from
iTunes and compatible iPods. It implements a server for the Apple RAOP protocol.

It probably supports multiple simultaneous streams, if your audio output chain
(as detected by libao) does so.

Setup
-----
* `make`
* `perl -MCPAN -e 'install Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA'`
* `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libcrypt-openssl-rsa-perl libportaudio-dev libhttp-request-ascgi-perl`

How to use it
-------------
1. Make sure avahi-daemon is running and the prerequisites are installed (see
INSTALL).
2. Edit shairport.pl with your favourite text editor to set the access
point name and/or password, if desired.
3. `perl shairport.pl`

The triangle-in-rectangle Airtunes logo will appear in the iTunes status bar of
any machine on the network, or on iPod play controls screen. Choose your access
point name to start streaming to the Shairport instance.

Thanks
------
Big thanks to David Hammerton for releasing an ALAC decoder, which is reproduced
here in full.
Thanks to everyone who has worked to reverse engineer the RAOP protocol - after
finding the keys, everything else was pretty much trivial.
Thanks also to Apple for obfuscating the private key in the ROM image, using a
scheme that made the deobfuscation code itself stand out like a flare.
Thanks to wtbw.
